# Irsec (IT-Anteckningar)

During my studies in the IT field, I accumulated numerous notes in the form of text files, images, and folders on my disk. The idea and goal of this project are to review and organize all of my notes into categories, and then display them on a website for faster and easier access when needed.

## Features
The notes are stored as files and folders on the disk and are uploaded to the database through an API (`api_db_populator.py`). Additionally, notes can be uploaded locally using the script `local_db_populator.py`. The website reflects the structure of these files and folders, where:
- Folders represent categories and subcategories.
- Files represent topics, each with descriptions.

## Project Timeline
The project was launched at the beginning of 2025, and at this stage, only new notes and those that I have reviewed and organized on the disk have been uploaded to the database.
