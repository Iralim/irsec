During my time studying the IT field, I have accumulated numerous notes in the form of text files, images, and folders on my disk. The idea and goal of this project are to review all of my notes, organize them into categories, and then display them on a website to provide faster and easier access when needed.

The notes are stored on the disk as files and folders and are uploaded to the database through an API: api_db_populator.py. Additionally, notes can be uploaded locally using local_db_populator.py. The website reflects the file and folder structure, where folders represent categories and subcategories, and files represent topics with descriptions.

The project was launched at the beginning of 2025, and at this stage, only new notes and those that I have reviewed and organized on the disk have been uploaded to the database.
